%%%%% CHOOSE PAGE LAYOUT
% This one will format for two-sided binding (ie left and right pages have mirror margins; blank pages inserted where needed):
%\documentclass[a4paper,twoside]{ociamthesis}

% This one will format for PDF output (ie equal margins, no extra blank pages):
\documentclass[a4paper,nobind,twoside]{ociamthesis} 


%%%%% SELECT YOUR DRAFT OPTIONS
% Three options going on here; use in any combination.  But remember to turn the first two off before generating a PDF to send to the printer!

% This adds a "DRAFT" footer to every normal page.  (The first page of each chapter is not a "normal" page.)
%\fancyfoot[C]{\emph{DRAFT}}  

% This highlights (in blue) corrections marked with (for words) \mccorrect{blah} or (for whole
% paragraphs) \begin{mccorrection} . . . \end{mccorrection}.  This can be useful for sending a PDF of
% your corrected thesis to your examiners for review.  Turn it off, and the blue disappears.
%\correctionstrue


%%%%% BIBLIOGRAPHY SETUP
% Note that your bibliography will require some tweaking depending on your department, preferred format, etc.
% The options included below are just very basic "sciencey" and "humanitiesey" options to get started.
% If you've not used LaTeX before, I recommend reading a little about biblatex/biber and getting started with it.
% If you're already a LaTeX pro and are used to natbib or something, modify as necessary.
% Either way, you'll have to choose and configure an appropriate bibliography format...

% The science-type option: numerical in-text citation with references in order of appearance.
%\usepackage[style=ieee, sorting=none, backend=biber, doi=false, isbn=false]{biblatex}
\usepackage{natbib}
\AtBeginDocument{\renewcommand{\bibname}{References}}

% Uncomment this if you want equation numbers per section (2.3.12), instead of per chapter (2.18):

%%%%% THESIS / TITLE PAGE INFORMATION
% Everybody needs to complete the following:
\title{Your DPhil Title}
\author{Your Name}
\college{Your College}
\department{Your Department}
% Your full degree name.  (But remember that DPhils aren't "in" anything.  They're just DPhils.)
\degree{Doctor of Philosophy}
% Term and year of submission, or date if your board requires (eg most masters)
\degreedate{Trinity 2025}


%%%%% YOUR OWN PERSONAL MACROS
% This is a good place to dump your own LaTeX macros as they come up.

% To make text superscripts shortcuts
\renewcommand{\th}{\textsuperscript{th}} % ex: I won 4\th place
\newcommand{\nd}{\textsuperscript{nd}}
\renewcommand{\st}{\textsuperscript{st}}
\newcommand{\rd}{\textsuperscript{rd}}

%%%%%                    THE ACTUAL DOCUMENT STARTS HERE                     %%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{document}

%%%%% CHOOSE YOUR LINE SPACING HERE
% This is the official option.  Use it for your submission copy and library copy:
\setlength{\textbaselineskip}{22pt plus2pt}
% This is closer spacing (about 1.5-spaced) that you might prefer for your personal copies:
%\setlength{\textbaselineskip}{18pt plus2pt minus1pt}

% You can set the spacing here for the roman-numbered pages (acknowledgements, table of contents, etc.)
\setlength{\frontmatterbaselineskip}{17pt plus1pt minus1pt}

% Leave this line alone; it gets things started for the real document.
\setlength{\baselineskip}{\textbaselineskip}

% MSB: define vertical separation from header for all pages, fixes large space at top of page in pages after chapter titlepage
\setlength{\headsep}{5mm}

%%%%% CHOOSE YOUR SECTION NUMBERING DEPTH HERE
% You have two choices.  First, how far down are sections numbered?  (Below that, they're named but
% don't get numbers.)  Second, what level of section appears in the table of contents?  These don't have
% to match: you can have numbered sections that don't show up in the ToC, or unnumbered sections that
% do.  Throughout, 0 = chapter; 1 = section; 2 = subsection; 3 = subsubsection, 4 = paragraph...

% The level that gets a number:
\setcounter{secnumdepth}{2}
% The level that shows up in the ToC:
\setcounter{tocdepth}{1}


%%%%% ABSTRACT SEPARATE
% This is used to create the separate, one-page abstract that you are required to hand into the Exam
% Schools.  You can comment it out to generate a PDF for printing or whatnot.
%\begin{abstractseparate}
	%\input{text/abstract} % Create an abstract.tex file in the 'text' folder for your abstract.
%\end{abstractseparate}


% JEM: Pages are roman numbered from here, though page numbers are invisible until ToC.  This is in
% keeping with most typesetting conventions.
\begin{romanpages}

% Title page is created here
\maketitle

% Include a tickbox to certify this is your own work unless stated otherwise

%%%%% DEDICATION -- If you'd like one, un-comment the following.
%\begin{dedication}
%This thesis is dedicated to\\
%someone\\
%for some special reason\\
%\end{dedication}

%%%%% ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS -- Nothing to do here except comment out if you don't want it.
\begin{acknowledgements}
 	\input{text/acknowledgements}

%%%%% ABSTRACT -- Nothing to do here except comment out if you don't want it.

%%%     MINI TABLES OF CONTENTS, FIGURES, TABLES       %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This lays the groundwork for per-chapter, mini tables of contents.  Comment the following line
% (and remove \minitoc from the chapter files) if you don't want this.  Un-comment either of the
% next two lines if you want a per-chapter list of figures or tables.

\dominitoc % include a mini table of contents
%\dominilof  % include a mini list of figures
%\dominilot  % include a mini list of tables

% This aligns the bottom of the text of each page.  It generally makes things look better.
